Prime Number Problem

A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers.  Your task is to create a method that tests a Long number input to see if it is a prime number. Below is a list of sample prime numbers you can use for testing:

 

2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 101. 

 

Your method should return true if it is prime and false if it is not.

 

The goal of your method is to:

1.       Return the correct result

2.       Be as efficient as possible so that your method will perform well

3.       Be robust so it does not fail

 

The method signature you are required to use is:

 

boolean isPrime(Long number)
